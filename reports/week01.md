# üìÖ Week 1: Git

## üõ†Ô∏è 1. What I Built
- **Summary**: Created a GitHub Issue, edited README.md in VS Code to add an "About Me" section, and linked the commit to automatically close the issue.
- **Key Tools Used**: Git, GitHub, VS Code
- **Artifact Location**: https://github.com/bettybluee/MLOps-Practical-1
- **How to Run** (if applicable):
  - **Installation steps:** Not needed
  - **Run commands:** 
      1. Open README.md in VS Code
      2. Edit and save the file
      3. git add README.md
      4. git commit -m "Add About Me section (closes #1)"
      5. git push
  - **Expected output:** Issue #1 is automatically closed on GitHub

## üîç 2. My Exploration
- **What I Investigated Further**:
  - Explored advanced Git commands including commit amendment, branch creation and switching, cherry-pick, reset, and revert
  - Hands-on experiments:
    - Amended existing commits to modify content and messages
    - Created branches and moved commits using cherry-pick
    - Used reset and revert to roll back commits or restore specific files
    - Practiced conflict resolution and using stash to save work in progress
- **Link to Evidence** (optional): https://github.com/bettybluee/git-practice-start/blob/main/terminal-log.txt

## ü§ñ 3. Use of GenAI (if applicable)
- **What I Asked It To Do**:
  - Requested explanations for Git commands and workflows for cherry-pick, reset, revert
  - Asked how to link GitHub Issues with commits for automatic closure
- **What I Got and Did With It**:
  - Followed AI‚Äôs guidance as reference for terminal commands
  - Adjusted commands and resolved errors during actual practice
- **Risks or Misuses You Noticed**:
  - AI instructions did not always match the real scenario, causing some command errors
  - Cherry-pick and reset commands require careful use to avoid losing commits

## üí¨ 4. Reflection
- This week‚Äôs work enabled a reproducible workflow through systematic commit and branch management using Git and GitHub Issues. Initially, I created an issue incorrectly in Classroom, so even after linking commits it did not close automatically, which caused some confusion. I was able to resolve this by linking it properly to my GitHub repository. The processes of HEAD movement, cherry-pick, reset, and revert were initially confusing but provided a deep understanding after practice. Moving and restoring commits across branches was particularly interesting. To help others understand this project, it would be useful to include a visual diagram showing issue-linked commits and branch structure.
